You will now begin the experiment and complete 3 drawings in succession from observing the scenes on the screen (there will be opportunities to pause between drawings).

Each drawing will be 15 minutes in duration. In some drawings, an opaque "mask" will obscure part of the scene based on your eye position -- in these cases, the mask will be present on screen for the first 10 minutes, then removed for the remaining 5 minutes. In other drawings, no mask will be present for the full 15 minutes.
