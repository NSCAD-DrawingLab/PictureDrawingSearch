You will now begin the experiment and complete 3 drawings in succession from observing the scenes on the screen.

Each drawing will be 15 minutes in duration. In some drawings, a "mask" will obscure part of the scene based on your eye position -- in these cases, the mask will be present on screen for the first 10 minutes, then removed for the remaining 5 minutes. In other drawings, no mask will be present for the full 15 minutes.

Please draw each scene, with the intent of making your drawing as accurate as possible. You will use the pencil, charcoal, smudger and eraser tools provided in the drawing software to complete this task.

Please do your best to use the entire 15 minutes allotted for this drawing. You will be notified at the 9 and 14 minute marks for your reference.

Note: A digital recording of your drawing, and digital data of your eye movements, will be retained for research purposes.
